## Distributed systems fundamentals

### 1. NCCL internals — ring vs tree algorithms, NVLink topology, GPU-level all-reduce/send/recv

NCCL's algorithm selection (ring, tree, NVLS, CollNet) is governed by message size, topology, and the `NCCL_ALGO` environment variable. Understanding this layer is essential for diagnosing why your pipeline send/recv calls behave differently across NVLink vs PCIe topologies.

- **NCCL User Guide** — covers communicators, collective operations, CUDA stream semantics, group calls, and algorithm selection. The environment variables page documents `NCCL_DEBUG`, `NCCL_ALGO`, and `NCCL_PROTO` for controlling and debugging algorithm choice.
  - https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/index.html
  - Environment variables: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html

- **Using NCCL with CUDA Graphs** — requirements and patterns for capturing NCCL operations inside CUDA graphs, which you will need for pipeline-parallel inference.
  - https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/usage/cudagraph.html

### 2. Deadlock patterns in multi-group distributed code

Deadlocks in multi-group code almost always stem from mismatched collective ordering across ranks or accidentally issuing operations on the wrong process group. `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` (or `WARN`) is your primary diagnostic tool.

- **PyTorch Distributed API Reference** — documents `init_process_group`, process group creation, backend selection, and timeout semantics. The timeout (default 10 minutes for NCCL) is critical to understand for deadlock diagnosis.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html

- **"Writing Distributed Applications with PyTorch"** (tutorial) — hands-on walkthrough of point-to-point and collective communication, backends comparison, and process group setup. Good for building intuition about ordering constraints.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html

- **"Building Scalable and Fault-Tolerant NCCL Applications"** (NVIDIA Developer Blog) — communicator management, dynamic rescaling, fault tolerance. Covers what happens when a rank fails mid-collective.
  - https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-scalable-and-fault-tolerant-nccl-applications

### 3. Graceful shutdown and draining in distributed PyTorch

Graceful shutdown in distributed PyTorch remains **underserved by documentation**. The core API is `destroy_process_group()`, but real-world challenges include ranks exiting at different times, CUDA graph capture preventing clean NCCL communicator destruction, and signal handling under `torchrun`.

- **PyTorch `destroy_process_group()` documentation** — within the distributed API reference. Call once near end of main(), blocking until all processes reach it.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html

- **GitHub Issue #115388: `destroy_process_group()` hangs after CUDA graph capture** — documents that `ncclCommDestroy` hangs when collectives were captured into CUDA graphs. Critical for inference workloads.
  - https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/115388

- **GitHub Issue #167775: Graceful Ctrl+C handling from torchrun** — active discussion on multi-GPU shutdown coordination under signal handling.
  - https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/167775

- **"Kill PyTorch Distributed Training Processes"** (Lei Mao) — practical patterns for fully releasing resources in distributed training, multi-node termination.
  - https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kill-PyTorch-Distributed-Training-Processes/

### 4. Determinism across ranks in distributed training/inference

Non-determinism in distributed settings comes from three sources: **CUDA atomicAdd operations** (non-associative floating-point), **cuDNN autotuning** selecting different algorithms per run, and **NCCL reduction order** across ranks.

- **PyTorch Reproducibility Guide** — the authoritative reference. Covers manual seeding, `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms()`, `cudnn.deterministic`, and lists all affected operations.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html

- **`torch.use_deterministic_algorithms` API** — complete list of operations with deterministic overrides, including Inductor no-autotune mode and Triton config selection.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.use_deterministic_algorithms.html

- **"Impacts of floating-point non-associativity on reproducibility for HPC and deep learning"** (arXiv) — rigorous study documenting how inter-chip communication introduces variation in distributed settings.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05148

## GPU execution model

### 5. CUDA streams — execution/dependency model, events, synchronization, NCCL interaction

Streams are the fundamental concurrency primitive for overlapping compute, communication, and memory transfers. NCCL operations execute on their own streams, and understanding how events synchronize across streams is essential for pipeline parallelism.

- **PyTorch CUDA Semantics** — comprehensive treatment of streams, events, the caching allocator, and CUDA graphs. The sections on stream synchronization semantics and backward pass stream behavior are especially important.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html

- **CUDA Programming Guide: Asynchronous Execution** — the authoritative NVIDIA reference on stream ordering, events, callbacks, and synchronization primitives.
  - https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/02-basics/asynchronous-execution.html

- **"CUDA Stream"** (Lei Mao) — clear, practical explanation of serial vs concurrent stream models, overlapping compute with memory copy, and stream synchronization patterns with code examples.
  - https://leimao.github.io/blog/CUDA-Stream/

### 6. CUDA graphs — what they capture, what breaks them, relation to torch.compile

CUDA graphs eliminate kernel launch overhead by recording a sequence of GPU operations and replaying them. They are **critical for inference latency** but impose strict constraints: all tensor addresses must be fixed, control flow cannot change, and memory allocation patterns must be static.

- **CUDA Programming Guide: CUDA Graphs** — complete coverage of graph definition vs execution, stream capture, memory allocations within graphs, instantiation, and dependency management.
  - https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/cuda-graphs.html

- **PyTorch CUDA Semantics (CUDA Graphs section)** — how PyTorch integrates CUDA graphs, graph-private memory pools, interaction with the caching allocator, and `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` API.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html

- **`torch.compile` with `mode="reduce-overhead"`** — uses CUDA graphs under the hood. The `torch.compile` API documentation describes the `triton.cudagraphs` option and related configuration.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.compile.html

- **NVIDIA CUDA Graph Best Practices for NCCL** — requirements for capturing NCCL operations in CUDA graphs, with Megatron-LM's `CudaGraphManager` as a reference implementation.
  - https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/usage/cudagraph.html

### 7. GPU memory management — PyTorch caching allocator, fragmentation

The PyTorch caching allocator avoids expensive `cudaMalloc`/`cudaFree` calls by maintaining a pool of allocated blocks. Fragmentation under dynamic workloads (variable sequence lengths, different denoising steps) is the primary operational concern.

- **PyTorch CUDA Semantics: Memory Management** — documents `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` options (`max_split_size_mb`, `backend`, `expandable_segments`), memory snapshots, and the allocator's block-splitting behavior.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html

- **`torch.cuda` Module Reference** — API for `memory_allocated()`, `memory_reserved()`, `memory_stats()`, `MemPool`, and the CUDA Sanitizer for detecting stream-ordered access errors.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/cuda.html

### 8. Kernel launch overhead — Python-to-GPU dispatch path

Each PyTorch operator call traverses Python → C++ dispatch → CUDA kernel launch. At **~10μs per launch**, this overhead dominates when running many small operations. `torch.compile` and CUDA graphs are the primary mitigations.

- **"Making Deep Learning Go Brrrr From First Principles"** (Horace He) — the definitive blog post explaining overhead-bound, memory-bound, and compute-bound regimes. The overhead section explains exactly why Python dispatch matters and how operator fusion eliminates it.
  - https://horace.io/brrr_intro.html

- **GPU MODE Lecture 6: "Optimizing Optimizers in PyTorch"** (Jane Xu) — covers kernel launch overhead, kernel fusion, and multi-tensor apply as a mitigation. Available on the GPU MODE channel.

## torch.compile and Inductor

### 9. How Dynamo tracing works — graph breaks, guards, eager fallback

TorchDynamo uses CPython's **PEP 523 frame evaluation API** to intercept Python bytecode execution, symbolically trace tensor operations into an FX graph, and generate guard functions that check whether cached compilations remain valid. When it encounters untraceable code (data-dependent control flow, unsupported Python constructs), it inserts a **graph break** — splitting the code into multiple compiled subgraphs with eager Python between them.

- **Dynamo Deep-Dive** (PyTorch docs) — the most comprehensive official resource on internals: PEP 523, VariableTracker system, guard generation, continuation functions at graph breaks, SymInt for dynamic shapes.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler_dynamo_deepdive.html

- **"How does torch.compile work?"** (UW PLSE Blog, Megan Frisella) — excellent pedagogical explanation with clear diagrams of the TorchDynamo architecture, graph extraction, and guard functions.

  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/user_guide/torch_compiler/compile/programming_model.html

### 10. Inductor fusion rules — what fuses, verification

TorchInductor's scheduler decides fusion using `score_fusion(node1, node2)`, which scores pairs of operations by **estimated memory traffic savings**. Pointwise-to-pointwise fusion is most common; reduction and template fusions have additional constraints.

- **"TorchInductor: a PyTorch-native Compiler with Define-by-Run IR and Symbolic Shapes"** (Jason Ansel, dev-discuss) — the foundational Inductor design document. Covers loop-level IR, TensorBox/StorageBox, Triton and C++ backends, and the breadth-first fusion approach.

- **TorchInductor `config.py`** (GitHub source) — the definitive reference for all fusion-related knobs: `epilogue_fusion`, `prologue_fusion`, `pattern_matcher`, `score_fusion_memory_threshold`, `benchmark_harness`.
  - https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/_inductor/config.py

- **"PyTorch 2: Faster Machine Learning Through Dynamic Python"** (ASPLOS 2024 paper) — Section on Inductor covers lowering (433 operators), `Scheduler.score_fusion`, persistent vs loop reductions in Triton codegen, and template epilogue fusions.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/assets/pytorch2-2.pdf

- **Inductor scheduler source and fusion discussion** — Jason Ansel clarifies: "Fusions always happen in the scheduler" via `can_fuse` heuristics. Points to `scheduler.py` for flush boundaries.
  - https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/disabling-codegen-specific-fusions-in-torchinductor-for-per-op-kernel-generation/3226

### 11. Functional collectives and Dynamo — why in-place breaks tracing, the funcol solution

Standard NCCL collectives (`all_reduce`, `all_gather`) are **in-place and side-effecting** — they mutate tensors and return opaque `Work` objects. This is fundamentally incompatible with functional graph tracing. Functional collectives (`torch.distributed._functional_collectives`) return new tensors and use `AsyncCollectiveTensor` subclasses for deferred synchronization, making them traceable by Dynamo.

- **RFC #93173: PT2-Friendly Traceable, Functional Collective Communication APIs** — the foundational design document. Explains why existing c10d APIs break tracing, defines the functional semantics, and specifies the `AsyncTensor` subclass approach.
  - https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/93173

- **`_functional_collectives.py` source** — the implementation. Shows `AsyncCollectiveTensor`, `traceable_collective_remaps`, `_c10d_functional` op registration, and `wait_tensor` synchronization.

  - https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/138773

### 12. Compile + distributed interaction — compile with DDP/FSDP/TP

The core challenge is that **DDP/FSDP use backward hooks for communication**, and these hooks create graph breaks in AOTAutograd. The solutions are: (1) **Compiled Autograd** (PyTorch 2.4+), which captures the full backward graph at runtime, (2) **FSDP2 built on DTensor**, which is compile-friendly by design, and (3) **functional collectives** for tensor parallelism.

- **Compiled Autograd Tutorial** — key resource. Shows how `compiled_autograd = True` unifies backward graphs despite forward graph breaks, enabling DDP/FSDP communication to be captured and optimized.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/compiled_autograd_tutorial.html

## Pipeline parallelism

### 13. Classic PP (GPipe, PipeDream) — micro-batching, 1F1B schedule, bubble fraction

Pipeline parallelism partitions a model across devices by layer. **GPipe** fills the pipeline with micro-batches and synchronizes at the end (high memory, simple). **PipeDream's 1F1B schedule** interleaves one forward and one backward per micro-batch, reducing peak activation memory from O(num_microbatches) to O(num_stages).

- **GPipe: Efficient Training of Giant Neural Networks using Pipeline Parallelism** (Huang et al., 2018) — the foundational synchronous PP paper. Introduces micro-batch splitting and re-materialization (activation checkpointing) for memory efficiency.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06965

- **PipeDream: Generalized Pipeline Parallelism for DNN Training** (Narayanan et al., 2019) — introduces the **1F1B schedule** and asynchronous weight updates with weight stashing. Up to 5x faster than data parallelism.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03377

- **Memory-Efficient Pipeline-Parallel DNN Training (PipeDream-2BW)** (Narayanan et al., 2020) — introduces PipeDream-Flush (synchronous 1F1B) and double-buffered weight updates. The 1F1B schedule from this paper is what most modern systems actually implement.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09503

  - https://siboehm.com/articles/22/pipeline-parallel-training

### 14. Activation memory in PP

Peak activation memory in PP depends on the schedule. GPipe stores activations for all micro-batches; 1F1B limits in-flight activations to `num_stages`. **Activation checkpointing** trades compute for memory by recomputing activations during backward.

- **Efficient Large-Scale Language Model Training on GPU Clusters Using Megatron-LM** (Narayanan et al., 2021) — the PTD-P paper. Proposes interleaved pipeline parallelism (virtual stages) that reduces bubble fraction from `(P-1)/(P-1+B)` to `(P-1)/(P-1+V·B)` at the cost of more communication. Detailed activation memory analysis.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04473

- **Zero Bubble Pipeline Parallelism** (Qi et al., 2024) — achieves zero pipeline bubbles by splitting backward into B (input gradient) and W (parameter gradient) phases. Up to **23–31% throughput improvement** over 1F1B. The key insight is that W has no data dependency on the next micro-batch.
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10241

- **PyTorch `torch.distributed.pipelining` API** — documents `ScheduleGPipe`, `Schedule1F1B`, `ScheduleInterleaved1F1B`, `ScheduleInterleavedZeroBubble`, and `ScheduleZBVZeroBubble`. The code is your best reference for how these schedules manage activation memory.
  - https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.pipelining.html

### 15. Pipeline scheduling theory — bubble fraction derivation, Little's law connection

The bubble fraction for a P-stage pipeline processing B micro-batches is **(P−1)/(B+P−1)**. This is a direct consequence of pipeline startup and drain latency. **Little's law** (L = λW) provides the framework: to keep P stages busy, you need at least P micro-batches in flight, and throughput approaches the ideal rate as B → ∞.

- **"How to Parallelize a Transformer for Training"** (JAX Scaling Book) — excellent treatment of all parallelism strategies with roofline analysis for communication bottlenecks. Covers pipeline bubble derivations and micro-batching tradeoffs.
  - https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/training/

  - https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/scaling-language-model-training-to-a-trillion-parameters-using-megatron/

- **Megatron-LM Pipeline Parallel Schedules source** — the reference implementation. `forward_backward_pipelining_with_interleaving` shows exactly how 1F1B and interleaved schedules manage micro-batch ordering.

## Performance analysis

### 16. Roofline model applied to transformers — arithmetic intensity for attention vs FFN

The roofline model plots achievable FLOPS against **arithmetic intensity** (FLOPS/byte of memory traffic). Attention is typically **memory-bandwidth-bound** (low arithmetic intensity due to reading/writing large KV matrices), while FFN layers are more likely **compute-bound** (high arithmetic intensity from large matrix multiplications). This distinction drives optimization strategy.

  - https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-hpc-applications-with-nsight-compute-roofline-analysis/

### 18. Bandwidth accounting from first principles

Bandwidth accounting means computing the **theoretical minimum memory traffic** for an operation, then comparing against measured bandwidth to determine utilization. For a matrix multiply C = A × B with dimensions (M, K) × (K, N), minimum traffic is `2(MK + KN + MN)` bytes (read A, read B, write C).

## Systems patterns

### 19. Producer-consumer with backpressure — bounded channels, ring buffers

In a pipeline-parallel inference system, each stage is a producer for the next stage. Without backpressure, a fast producer can overwhelm a slow consumer, causing OOM or unbounded latency. **Bounded queues** are the simplest correct solution: block the producer when the queue is full.

- **"Backpressure explained — the resisted flow of data through software"** (Jay Phelps) — the canonical backpressure explainer. Covers strategies: control the producer, buffer, or drop. Widely referenced.

  - https://www.warpstream.com/blog/dealing-with-rejection-in-distributed-systems

### 20. Message framing and versioning

When pipeline stages communicate over network boundaries (multi-node inference), you need message framing (length-prefixed or delimited) and versioning for forward/backward compatibility as the system evolves.

- **"Message Framing"** (Stephen Cleary) — classic TCP message framing explainer. Length prefixing vs delimiters, implementation for partial receives.

  - https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/

### 21. Idempotency and replay

For fault tolerance in a streaming video pipeline, operations should be idempotent — re-executing a denoising step or VAE decode with the same inputs produces the same output. Combined with **replay from checkpointed state**, this gives you exactly-once semantics without distributed transactions.

- **"What is Idempotency in Distributed Systems?"** (AlgoMaster) — idempotency keys, HTTP method idempotency, state management patterns.

## Domain-specific: video DiT inference

### 22. KV cache management in streaming inference

KV caches store the key/value projections from previous tokens to avoid recomputation during autoregressive generation. In video DiT streaming, this extends to **temporal KV caches** across denoising steps and frames. PagedAttention (from vLLM) introduced OS-style paged memory management, reducing waste from **60–80% to under 4%**.

### 23. VAE latency and chunking for video

The VAE decoder is often the **latency bottleneck** in video generation pipelines. 3D VAEs compress both spatially and temporally (typical compression: 8×8×4), but decoding back to pixel space is expensive. **Tiled decoding** splits the latent spatially, **temporal chunking** with causal convolution caching enables frame-by-frame streaming decode.

Video DiT scheduling determines how denoising steps are ordered and parallelized across frames. **Rolling window** approaches generate video autoregressively: each window of N frames shares context from the previous window, enabling arbitrarily long generation. **Stream Batch** (from StreamDiffusion) batches denoising steps across time for throughput.

- **StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation** (Kodaira et al., 2023) — introduces Stream Batch (staggered denoising across frames), Residual CFG for **2.05x speedup** over standard CFG, and Stochastic Similarity Filter. **91.07 fps** on RTX 4090.

## Suggested reading order

For someone building a pipeline-parallel video DiT inference system, the following sequence maximizes learning efficiency by building concepts in dependency order:

1. **Foundations first**: Horace He's "Making Deep Learning Go Brrrr" (topic 16) → PyTorch CUDA Semantics (topics 5–7) → CUDA graphs programming guide (topic 6)
2. **Compiler layer**: Dynamo Deep-Dive (topic 9) → Inductor design doc by Jason Ansel (topic 10) → Edward Yang's "State of torch.compile" (topics 11–12)
3. **Distributed layer**: NCCL User Guide (topic 1) → Functional collectives RFC (topic 11) → PyTorch distributed pipelining API (topics 13–14)
4. **Pipeline parallelism theory**: GPipe paper → PipeDream-2BW paper → Zero Bubble PP paper → Megatron-LM schedules source code (topics 13–15)
5. **Domain-specific**: DiT paper → StreamDiffusion → StreamDiffusionV2 → PipeDiT → CogVideoX VAE documentation (topics 22–24)
6. **Integration**: vLLM architecture blog → torch.compile + vLLM blog → profiling compiled distributed code (topics 17–18)

The total corpus is roughly **40–50 hours of reading** and **10–15 hours of video content**. Prioritize the bolded foundational resources in each section — you can reach working competence in ~20 hours by focusing on those alone.
